# QuizConfigurator (Labb3)

For my third school project, I developed a WPF application utilizing the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern. The application allows users to create custom quizzes and participate in them. Each quiz question is presented randomly, accompanied by four possible answers. Users must select the correct answer within a specified time limit.
